        “The Art of Being Alone” by Renuka Gavrani is less of a book and more of a survival guide for dodging those pesky humans that keep wanting to ‘connect’ and ‘hang out’. Gavrani, in a less-tedious-than-a-family-reunion way, sifts through the confetti of solitude, distinguishing between the despair of ‘I’m a lonely potato’ and the triumphant ‘I’m an independent potato’. Her manifesto makes a compelling case that grabbing some me-time in this emoji-ridden era isn’t just good ol’ fun, it’s a quest for inner zen. So, if you’ve ever wanted to be left alone without being labelled as a hermit, this book might just be your new best friend – quiet, understanding, and doesn’t expect you to share your fries.

        “The Art of Being Alone” is both a guide and a meditation, offering practical advice for those seeking to find solace in solitude and encouraging readers to view alone time as a valuable resource for emotional and spiritual nourishment. It appeals to anyone looking to deepen their understanding of themselves and their relationship with the world around them.
